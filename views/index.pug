    p These are a few of some of my projects ive been working on in my journey to become a full stack web developer. I hope these projets showcase my ability to learn and adapt to new concepts and frameworks as my learning odyssey continues. as i grow more i will include more projects not just using javascript but python, c# and/or java as well. Be on the look out for those.

          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
